# Child event journeys

Welcome!

This code was originally developed by [Celine Gross](https://github.com/Cece78) at Social Finance as part of a grant funded programme to support Local Authorities to collaborate on data analysis. The programme was called the ‘Front Door Data Collaboration’. It was supported financially by the Christie Foundation and Nesta (through the ‘What Works Centre for Children’s Social Care’). The LAs whose staff guided its development were Bracknell Forest, West Berkshire, Southampton, and Surrey. It also benefitted from advice from the National Performance and Information Managers Group and from the Ofsted Social Care Inspection Insight team.

We are happy to share this code hoping that others may benefit from a quick way to draw children journeys from their Annex A.

This code is for data analysts from a Local Authority or from another body holding Annex A data. Little Python knowledge is required to run this code.
